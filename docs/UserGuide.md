FitBook is a **desktop app for managing clients, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still 
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a personal trainer that prefers typing over mouse 
interactions, FitBook is the perfect application for you to manage your clients!

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Editing a client : `edit`

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [note/NOTE] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the clients at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list. 
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the client will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the client’s tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st client to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* Any fields can be searched.
* Multiple fields can be search in one command
  * All fields must match (e.g `find n/Wendy p/91234567` will match with a contact whose name contains `wendy` and phone number contains `91234567`)
* All fields except `TAG` will be matched based on substring (e.g `Wen` will match `Wendy`)
* `TAG` must be an exact match (case-insensitive)
  * E.g `find t/fri` will not match the tag `friend`

Examples:
* `find n/Wendy` returns `Wendy Son` and `Wendy Kim`
  ![result for 'find n/Wendy'](images/FindNameMultiple.png)

FitBook data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. 
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, FitBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause FitBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install FitBook in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous FitBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
