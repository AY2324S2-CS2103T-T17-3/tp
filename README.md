# FitBook
FitBook is an easy-to-use address book that is geared towards freelance photographers.
Features such as the integration of a task list for each contact allows photographers
to effectively track tasks with clients.

The main way to interact with FitBook is via the keyboard. This allows photographers to quickly manage
their clients, while still having a GUI that provides a visually pleasing experience to the user.
